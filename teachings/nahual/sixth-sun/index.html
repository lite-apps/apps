            It is a sad evening for Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, Tlatelolco.<br/><br/>

            The moon and the stars are winning this battle,<br/>
            Leaving us in darkness and despair.<br/><br/>

            Let's lock ourselves up in our houses,<br/>
            Let's leave the paths and the maketplaces deserted,<br/>
            Lets's hide deep in our hearts our love for the codices, the ball game, the dances, the temples, 
            Let's secretly preserve the wisdom that our honourable grandparents taught us with great love,<br/><br/>

            And this knowledge will pass from parents to children, from teachers to students,<br/><br/>

            Until the rising of the Sixth Sun,<br/>

            When the new wise men will bring it back and save Mexico.<br/>

            In the meantime, let's dance and remember the glory of Tenochtitlan,<br/>

                  Repetitions: Daily | Time Period: Sunrise | Frequency: As needed

                  Do this to invite the essence of Huitzilopochtli into your life, to recover discipline in the tonal and develop the gift of making prophecies in the nahual.
                  <br/>
                  1. Go to a place where you can see the sunrise (symbolizes the Huitzilin flying left)
                  <br/>
                  2. Communicate with the sun Tonatiuh (hummingbird) by formulating the intent of recovering your discipline and willpower and of seeing the hummingbird while dreaming so that you are able to follow it and receive prophetic powers.
                  <br/>
                  3. Look directly at the sun for a few moments, then say out loud "Xihualhi" meaning come, 4 times.
                  <br/>
                  4. Close your eyes and you will see a small electric blue dot moving quickly to your left. This is the sun that in the nahual is transforming into a hummingbird.
                  <br/>
                  5. Repeat this at least 4 times and each time the shape of the small dot will become clearer taking the outline of a hummingbird. 
                  <br/>
                  6. Do this daily at sunrise, so within a short period of time the Sun will restore your will and the hummingbird will start to appear to you in your dreams. 
                  <br/>
                  7. If Huitzilin the hummingbird appears in your dreams be sure to follow it immediately through the blue fog or light and it will lead you into the future where you will have prophetic vision.
